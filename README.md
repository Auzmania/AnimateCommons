**What is EdgeCommons?**

The purpose of this extension library is to improve the workflow and enhance the possibilities of Animate compositions. There are several components available, such as Parallax Scrolling, Spotlight Overlay or Adaptive Layouts. The components listed here are already tested and documented. We are, however, steadily working on new features and components.

The Edge Commons are completely open source and therefor free to use in personal and commercial projects. If you are interested, you can also contribute to the project on GitHub.
